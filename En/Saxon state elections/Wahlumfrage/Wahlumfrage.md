### Comment:

The article underscores the complexities of the upcoming Saxon state election, with no clear path to forming a stable government. The rise of parties like AfD and BSW reflects growing discontent with traditional parties and indicates a shift towards more extreme political positions. The significant influence of national issues, particularly migration and the Ukraine-Russia conflict, highlights the interconnectedness of regional and federal politics in shaping voter behavior. The article also points to a potential challenge for future governance in Saxony, where deeply polarized views could make coalition-building particularly difficult.
